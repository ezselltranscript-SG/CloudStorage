## Technical Architecture

The Admin Dashboard is built as a modular component within the main application, following these architectural principles:

### Directory Structure
```
src/
└── admin/
    ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
    │   ├── common/       # Shared components like tables, forms
    │   ├── users/        # User management components
    │   ├── roles/        # Role management components
    │   ├── files/        # File management components
    │   ├── analytics/    # Analytics components
    │   ├── settings/     # Settings components
    │   └── layout/       # Layout components
    ├── context/          # React context providers
    ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
    ├── pages/            # Page components
    ├── services/         # API services
    ├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
    └── utils/            # Utility functions
```

### Key Components

1. **AdminLayout**: Base layout for all admin pages with navigation and permission checks
2. **PermissionGuard**: Component to restrict access based on user permissions
3. **StateDisplay**: Handles loading, error, and empty states consistently
4. **AdminFileExplorer**: File management interface for administrators
5. **UserTable**: Interactive table for user management
6. **RoleMatrix**: Permission management interface
7. **AnalyticsDashboard**: Data visualization components
8. **AuditLogTable**: Filterable table for audit logs
9. **OrganizationSettings**: Settings management interface

### Authentication & Authorization

The Admin Dashboard uses a permission-based authorization system:

1. **Permission Types**: Fine-grained permissions (e.g., `view_users`, `manage_roles`, `view_audit_logs`)
2. **Role-Based Access**: Permissions are grouped into roles
3. **Permission Hooks**: `usePermissions` and `useHasPermission` hooks for permission checks
4. **Route Guards**: `PermissionGuard` component to protect routes

## Usage Guide

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard is accessible at the `/admin` route. Only users with administrative permissions can access this area.

### User Management

1. Navigate to "Users" in the sidebar
2. Use filters and search to find specific users
3. Click on a user to view details or edit
4. Use the "Add User" button to create new users
5. Assign roles using the dropdown in the user edit form

### Role Management

1. Navigate to "Roles" in the sidebar
2. View existing roles and their permissions
3. Create new roles with the "Add Role" button
4. Use the permission matrix to assign permissions to roles
5. Save changes with the "Save" button

### File Management

1. Navigate to "Files" in the sidebar
2. Use filters to find specific files or folders
3. View file details by clicking on a file
4. Use the action menu for operations like download, restore, or delete
5. Use "View as User" to impersonate a user's view

### Analytics

1. Navigate to "Analytics" in the sidebar
2. View key metrics on the dashboard
3. Use date range selectors to filter data
4. Export reports using the export buttons

### Audit Logs

1. Navigate to "Audit Logs" in the sidebar
2. Use filters to find specific activities
3. View details of each action
4. Export logs using the "Export" button

### System Settings

1. Navigate to "Settings" in the sidebar
2. Modify organization settings as needed
3. Toggle features on/off
4. Set storage limits and quotas
5. Save changes with the "Save" button

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Auditing**: Review audit logs regularly for security monitoring
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign only necessary permissions to roles
3. **Test Changes**: Test configuration changes in a staging environment first
4. **Backup Settings**: Export important settings before making significant changes
5. **Monitor Analytics**: Regularly review analytics to identify trends and issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure the user has the correct role and permissions
2. **Missing Data**: Check if filters are applied that might be hiding data
3. **Slow Performance**: Large data sets might require pagination or additional filtering
4. **Export Failures**: Check file size limits and network connectivity

### Support

For additional support, contact the system administrator or refer to the technical documentation.

## Future Enhancements

1. Advanced reporting and custom dashboards
2. Integration with external authentication providers
3. Automated compliance reporting
4. Batch operations for file management
5. Enhanced analytics with predictive insights
